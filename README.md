The programming language used is Java, I used the IDE netbeans so you can just import the project if you have installed Netbeans.

In other case, open the terminal on /Minesweeper/Minesweeper/dist and execute java -jar Minesweeper.jar for Linux

In Windows is the same, open the terminal on the directory dist and execute java -jar Minesweeper.jar
